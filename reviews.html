                            <p>The expansion introduces Outland, the former world of Draenor, and numerous quests essentially allowing players to explore the world on their own. The main storyline points to Illidan the Betrayer and what happened to him during the last four years. Players can also complete quests that involve either aiding Illidan or making preparations for his downfall.</p>

                            <p>In addition, there are many links between the former world of Draenor and the current Outland, such as the opening of the Dark Portal by Medivh, which is relived in the Caverns of Time, and various quest chains which provide insight into the history of the old Orcish shamans and their relationship with Burning Legion long before the First War.</p>

                            <p>Four years after the Battle of Mount Hyjal, tensions between the Alliance and the Horde begin to arise once again.[10] Intent on settling the arid region of Durotar, Thrall's new Horde expanded its ranks, inviting the undead Forsaken to join orcs, tauren, and trolls. Meanwhile, dwarves, gnomes and the ancient night elves pledged their loyalties to a reinvigorated Alliance, guided by the human kingdom of Stormwind. After Stormwind's king Varian Wrynn mysteriously disappeared, Highlord Bolvar Fordragon served as Regent, but his service was marred by the manipulations and mind control of the black dragon Onyxia, who ruled in disguise as a human noblewoman. As heroes investigated Onyxia's manipulations, ancient foes surfaced in lands throughout the world to menace Horde and Alliance alike.</p>

                    <p>Classic is classic! Not much else to say. Very slow to level, very jank, but has a beautiful nostalgic glean to it.</p>

                    <h2>Classic and Anniversary</h2>
                    <p>Though these are just rereleases, they deserve a bit of a spotlight as well, and also serve as a source of nostalgia for many people. For me, I started playing seriously during <a href="#wotlk">WOTLK</a> Classic and it was the most fun I've had playing WOW! Though slower than current expansions, and raids and dungeons not nearly as hard, as well as lacking a real difficulty slider, it still has lots of jank fun and an active community. Recommend!</p>
